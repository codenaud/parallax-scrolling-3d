# Parallax Scrolling 3D

[![Masking Text on Image Screenshots](assets/screenshots/git-screenshot01.png)](https://codenaud.github.io/parallax-scrolling-3d/)

## Description

This project focuses on creating a home page with a stunning parallax scrolling effect using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal is to offer users an engaging and dynamic visual experience as they explore the content on the page.

The parallax scrolling effect is a technique that allows images and content to move at different speeds as users scroll the page. This creates a sense of depth and movement, drawing the user's attention and adding an exciting touch to the browsing experience.

**Note:** The parallax effect is mainly achieved through the `wheel` event, which detects the movement of the mouse wheel. Since this event focuses on mouse interaction, the experience on mobile devices may be different or limited due to differences in touch interaction. It is recommended to experiment with this project on desktop devices for an optimal experience.

## Live Demo

## Features

- **Background Images:** Three PNG images are used superimposed on a background image to create the parallax effect. Each of these images moves at a different speed when scrolling.

- **Custom Text:** Custom text has been incorporated that also moves with the parallax effect. This allows the user to read informative or engaging content while browsing.

- **Interaction with Wheel Event:** JavaScript has been implemented to control user interaction. The `wheel` event is used to detect the movement of the mouse wheel, allowing images and text to scroll according to the scroll direction and speed.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: HTML5 is used to structure and organize the content of the web page.
- CSS3: CSS3 is used to apply styles and visual effects, including text masking.
- JavaScript Vanilla: To handle interactivity and dynamic content.
- Photoshop: For designing the layout and visuals.
- Code Editor: A code editor is used to write and edit the source code of the project.
